Dr. WANG Dan received her PhD degree from Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong in 2014. Afterwards, she pursued her research in multiple institutes, including City University of Hong Kong (2015 - Postdoc, 2019 - RF), Caritas Institute of Higher Education (2016 - AP), National University of Singapore (2017~2018 - RF) and University of Shanghai for Science and Technology (2020~2022 - AP). She is now working as an Assistant Professor in School of Science and Technology, Hong Kong Metropolitan University. Dr. WANG Dan's research is focused on structural bioinformatics and health informatics. Detailed research topics include (1) Designing structure-based scoring functions (SFs) for protein-ligand binding-affinity prediction (BAP) in structure-based drug design, (2) Target-specific BAP and drug-efficacy exploration in studies of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and (3) Data processing and knowledge mining in massive Electronic Medical Records (EMRs).
